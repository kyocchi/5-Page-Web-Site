            <p><strong>In Japan, it is customary to eat special dishes that are different from usual during seasonal events and festivals.<br/>For example, on New Year's Day, Hinamatsuri, and Children's Day, we prepare feasts and special foods. <br/>At the turn of the seasons and in the strangest moments of life, we offer a feast to the gods in gratitude for the <br/> food we eat. I have always hoped that happiness would come to me. <br/> Also, it was a great pleasure to eat seasonal foods on the day of the event and enjoy the feeling of the season. We also have some chidren's songs for that.</strong> </p>
