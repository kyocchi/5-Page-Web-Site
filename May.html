                <p>Kodomo no Hi (Children’s Day) has been celebrated since ancient times. The day was originally called Tango no Sekku, which was a celebration of boys and fathers only. It was celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth moon of each lunar year. </p>

                <p>Two special edible treats are served on Children’s Day. Kashiwa-mochi (柏餅) are soft rice cakes stuffed with sweet red bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves. The oak leaves represent the continuing health of the family down the generations because it is believed that old oak leaves do not fall until new leaves have grown. The other treat that is commonly eaten is chimaki (ちまき) a long sweet sticky rice dumpling which is wrapped in bamboo leaves.</p>
