        <p><strong>Japan, it is customary to eat special dishes that are different from usual during seasonal events and festivals.<br/>For example, on New Year's Day, Hinamatsuri, and Children's Day, we prepare feasts and special foods. <br/>At the turn of the seasons and in the strangest moments of life, we offer a feast to the gods in gratitude for the <br/> food we eat. I have always hoped that happiness would come to me. <br/> Also, it was a great pleasure to eat seasonal foods on the day of the event and enjoy the feeling of the season.</strong> </p>

        <p>Children eat kashiwa-mochi, or rice cakes stuffed with bean paste and wrapped in oak leaves which symbolize strength. <br/>Chimaki, or dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, are also consumed. Iris flowers, which correspondingly bloom in early <br/>May, are symbolically placed in homes to ward off evil. In addition, it is customary to take baths known as syobuyu, which<br/> are filled with floating iris leaves.
