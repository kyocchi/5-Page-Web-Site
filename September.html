                <p>After the end of the summer, when temperatures begins to drop, you will hear people mentioning the words Jugoya or Tsukimi. These words refer to the "the night of the Harvest Full Moon," the traditional custom of celebrating the autumn harvest.</p>

                <p>In Japan, dango rice cakes and pampas grass are displayed in the home during Tsukimi ("viewing the moon").The reason behind this custom comes from the festival celebrating the crops.
                    The pampas grass represents the rice grains and wishes for good crops for the year. The pampas grass is also said to ward away evil.
                    The round rice cakes represent the full moon and have been used as an offering to pray for the good health of children and their descendants.</p>
